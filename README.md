# NX devkit extension

This is a monorepo for NX utilities:

- [nx-publisher](packages/publisher/README.md) An alternative way how to publish packages just using `npm version` command in your root project. Only affected packages will be published with a new version.
- [nx-ts-config](packages/nx-ts-config/README.md) Use project.ts in addition to project.json for better experience and advanced scenarios
